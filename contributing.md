2. **Use case** - *explain how we can simulate the user's point of view problem.*
3. **Browsers** - *is a problem in all browsers, if not what are they?*
4. **Related issues** - *is there any issue related to the subject?*
5. **Suggest a fix** - *can you suggest a fix to the problem.*

*The issue name should clear what the objective is. It is not necessary to include other information.*
